suggestions = [
    "**Flaw-1**\n- Ensure that the server binds the `sessionId` with the `QrId` when generating the QR code.\n- Validate that the `sessionId` is checked against the `QrId` on each polling request to confirm the legitimacy of the requester.\n",
    "**Flaw-2**\n- Set an expiration time for each `QrId` to prevent reuse after a successful login.\n- Invalidate the `QrId` immediately after the user completes the QRLogin process.\n",
    "**Flaw-3**\n- Use a strong randomization process for generating `QrId` to ensure they are not easily predictable.\n- Incorporate a mix of alphanumeric characters and appropriate length to enhance the complexity of `QrId`.\n",
    "**Flaw-4**\n- Generate `QrId` on the server-side to prevent client-side manipulation.\n",
    "**Flaw-5**\n- Strengthen the validation of `app_token` on the server to ensure it matches the user's identity before authorizing the login.\n- Avoid relying solely on user identifiers like phone numbers for authentication without verifying the corresponding `app_token`.\n",
    "**Flaw-6**\n- Review and remove any unnecessary transmission of sensitive user data during the QRLogin process.\n- Ensure all sensitive information is encrypted during transmission and is not exposed in server responses.\n"
